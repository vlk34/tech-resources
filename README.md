## Rocket.new Project Generator Prompt

Here’s my CV (pasted below). I want you to carefully analyze my skills, work experience, education, and any technologies or tools I’ve listed. Based on this, generate 3 unique and practical project ideas that would strengthen my CV. Each project should:

Showcase my existing skills while also introducing 1–2 new but related skills that employers value.

Be realistic enough to complete in a short timeframe (2–4 weeks).

Directly align with roles I might apply for (e.g., software engineering, data science, web dev, etc.).

Have a clear real-world application that I can explain in an interview.

For each project idea, provide:

A project title

A short description (what the project does)

Technologies/tools required

The main skills this project highlights

Finally, select ONE ‘best fit’ project for me. For that project, give me a step-by-step build outline (from setup to final version) so I can easily copy it into Rocket.new and start building. Make sure the outline is clear, structured, and detailed enough to be actionable.
